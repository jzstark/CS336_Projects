"Tom, can I have some blocks too?" Lily asked. She wanted to make a bridge for her cars.
"No, these are mine. Go find your own," Tom said. He did not want to share with his sister. He pulled the blocks closer to him.
Lily felt sad and angry. She did not think Tom was being nice. She looked at his tower and had an idea. She decided to pull one of the blocks at the bottom of the tower.
Suddenly, the tower fell down with a loud crash. All the blocks and cars scattered on the floor. Tom and Lily were shocked. They felt the floor shake and heard a rumble. It was an earthquake!

"Look, mom, a red bird!" Lily said, pointing to a cardinal.
"That's a pretty bird, Lily. Do you know what it is called?" mom asked.
"A cardinal, mom. I learned it in school," Lily said proudly.
"Very good, Lily. And do you know what that yellow bird is, Max?" mom asked, pointing to a canary.
"A canary, mom. I learned it in school, too," Max said.
"Wow, you are both very smart. Do you want to learn another bird name?" mom asked.

"I like to sing, mom. Can we sing a song?" Max asked.
